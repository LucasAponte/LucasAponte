<h1>Hi there 👋 :D, I'm Lucas Aponte — an enthusiastic developer who loves understanding how things work. 💻</h1>

<h3>🎓 I'm currently studying Communication Systems Engineering at UTN (Argentina), and complementing it with FullStack development courses and personal projects.</h3>

<h3>🎬 I'm working on <strong>CineRuka</strong>, a personal project where I'm building a movie theater reservation system using Node.js and Express. You can check it out in my repositories!</h3>

<h3>💼 I'm deeply interested in roles like <strong>FullStack Developer</strong> and <strong>Solution Architect</strong>, and long-term I aim to become a <strong>Project Manager</strong>.</h3>

<h3>🧠 I'm passionate about how companies manage and extract value from their data, and I'm exploring areas like software architecture, team leadership, and AI.</h3>

<h3>📫 Let's connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-g-aponte/">LinkedIn</a> to stay in touch and collaborate! 🤝</h3>

<h3>⚡ Fun fact: Besides coding, I enjoy playing volleyball and reading personal growth books 📚</h3>
